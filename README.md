# Parkinsons Disease Detection

# Objective:
Our project aims to build a Machine Learning model which will predict the 
probability of a person getting Parkinson’s disease. The data set has been acquired 
from Kaggle (website:- https://www.kaggle.com/nidaguler/parkinsons-data-set)

# How is it socially relevant?
Parkinson’s disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder which affects quality of 
life of an estimated 10 million people worldwide. The onset of the disorder starts with 
mild tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement and posture instability. 
Since these symptoms do not present themselves as serious , it is common for 
people to overlook these symptoms, hence it becomes crucial for its early diagnosis. 
There's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, but treatments are available to help 
relieve the symptoms and maintain your quality of life. These treatments include: 
supportive therapies, such as physiotherapy, medication.
